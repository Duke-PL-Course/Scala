## Day 2: Clipping Bushes and Other New Tricks

### Find

* A discussion on how to use Scala files

[StackOverflow: Read entire file in Scala?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1284423/read-entire-file-in-scala)

[Functional Scala: Closures](http://gleichmann.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/functional-scala-closures/)

## Do

* Use foldLeft to compute the total size of a list of strings.

* Write a Censor trait with a method that will replace the curse words Shoot and Darn with Pucky and Beans alternatives. Use a map to store the curse words and their alternatives.

* Load the curse words and alternatives from a file.
